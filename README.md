# Term 4 FIP
## Group Members Brody Billings, Roy Chan, Evan Hansen, Matthew Tenuta and Giovanni Perruzzi

<br>

This is the submission file for our groups Term 4 Fip campaign.
<br>

A brief summary. This is a micro-website for our campaign to bradcast the effects and impacts of Bullying in e-sports and what we plan on doing to counter the issue that is currently growing. This assaignment will feature many things weve learned over the semeter such as SASS, Vue, Ajax and the Fetch API and PHP and lumen/laravel.

Each form also features a unique key that is cached once the user completes the form. So if you would like to test it multiple times you will have to open it in a different window.

Feel free to look at this [Google Docs](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Ft7QOTgrdW0cAA29n3YYRMW8-zdodazj?usp=sharinghttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Ft7QOTgrdW0cAA29n3YYRMW8-zdodazj?usp=sharing) folder for planning and problem solving and extra assets not found in the project.
